==============================

Distribution estimation
-----------------------
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick two datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/datasets
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how machine learning can be used to model distributions within the dataset
5. Build a heuristic and/or algorithm to model the data using mixture models of probability distributions programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
